# SP-Android-Studio-Project

This is NOT the complete mobile app project that I made and is not fully functional, there are about 1 or 2 major functionalities that are missing from what I remember.
My hard drive containing my projects bricked a year ago and I am unable to recover the full project.

Functionalities missing:
1. Search bar that will allow users to type in their location and and enter their destination
2. Geofence functionality that will notify user when they are nearing their destination
